Oven roasted asparagus with Serrano ham is a delicious side dish that is easy to prepare and pairs well with a variety of main courses. The combination of the roasted asparagus and the savory Serrano ham creates a perfect blend of flavors.

## Ingredients

- 1 bunch of fresh asparagus spears
- 4-6 slices of Serrano ham (or prosciutto if Serrano ham is unavailable)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon balsamic glaze (optional, for drizzling)
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. Trim the tough ends of the asparagus spears by snapping them off at their natural breaking point or by using a knife. Place the trimmed asparagus on a baking sheet.

3. Drizzle the asparagus with olive oil, minced garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Toss the asparagus to coat evenly, ensuring each spear is well-seasoned.

4. Cook the asparagus in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until tender. Remove the asparagus from the oven and allow it to cool slightly.

5. Take each asparagus spear and wrap it with a slice of Serrano ham, starting from the bottom and spiraling upward. Repeat for all the asparagus spears.

6. Place the baking sheet back in the oven and roast for 12-15 minutes or until the Serrano ham becomes crispy.

7. Once roasted, remove the asparagus from the oven. Arrange the spears on a serving platter, drizzle with balsamic glaze if desired, and sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley for a burst of color and flavor.

8. Serve the oven-roasted asparagus with Serrano ham immediately as a delicious side dish. The combination of the roasted asparagus and the savory Serrano ham creates a perfect blend of flavors.

This dish is not only tasty but also visually appealing, making it a great addition to any meal. Adjust the seasoning and cooking time according to your preferences and the thickness of the asparagus spears.
