Quesadillas made with corn tortillas, melted cheese and fried corn. Very easy and quick to prepare.

## Ingredients
* 12 corn tortillas
* 2 cups of shredded Mozzarella cheese
* 1 cup of Havarti cheese in cubes
* 1/2 cup of cilantro
* 1 onion (optional)
* 6 corn on the cob
* Kosher salt (as needed)
* Canola oil (as needed)


## Preparation

1. Cook the corn on the cob and let it cool down.
2. Take the corn from the cob with a knife and fried in a pan with a bit of oil and 1/2 tsp cumin until golden brown. Optionally you can add a finely chopped onion.
3. Preheat the oven to 425F.
4. Put the tortillas in a pan with a few drops of oil and a bit of kosher salt.
5. After 2 or 3 minutes, take them out of the oven and flip them.
6. Before putting them back in the oven add the cheese and corn. 
7. Put the mix of cheese and corn in one tortilla and cover with the other one. Cooke until the cheese melts (1 or 2 minutes).
8. If you want serve without another tortilla on top you can put cheese and corn mix on each tortilla and cook until it melts and is a bit more crispy (2 min or so).
9. Usually serve with salsa, we recommend the [Tomatillo fresh salsa]({% post_url 2021-07-05-tomatillo-avocado-sauce %}).
