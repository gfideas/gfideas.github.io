This stew is based on the Birria recipes we have been experimenting with. Though is straightforward to make it takes time to put all the ingredients together. The tomato based salsa gives the flavor to the Birria. We like it really spicy so we used a combination of dried chiles we bought in San Diego at a Mexican super market. You can change the quantities or replace them with other chiles less spicy to adjust the amount of heat.

## Ingredients

### For the sauce
* 8 Roma tomatoes
* 1/2 Onion
* 1/2 Pepper
* 2 Cloves
* 1 Head of garlic
* 2 Habanero chiles
* 10 to 15 Chile de Arbol
* 8 Chile Guajillo
* 3 Chile Negro
* 5 Chile Pasilla
* 1 Teaspoon of peppercorns
* 1 Stalks of celery
* 1 Lime for juice
* Kosher salt (as needed)
* Olive oil (as needed)

### For the stew
* 1 Pound Pica√±a
* 1 Pound bottom blade roast
* 1 Onion
* 1 Carrot
* 2 Stalks of celery
* 2 Cups of beef stock
* Kosher salt (as needed)
* Olive oil (as needed)

### To plate
* Finely chopped onion
* Limes (as needed)
* Cilantro


## Preparation

1. Put all the ingredients for the salsa in the oven in a roast pan for 15 minutes until the tomatoes are soft.
2. Take ingredients out of the oven and wait for them to cool down a bit.
3. Put everything in the blender and blend until smooth. Add salt and lime juice to taste and put aside.
4. Put the meat, veggies chopped, beef stock in a pressure cooker (Instant Pot or similar) adding one or two cups of water.
5. Cook in high pressure for 15 minutes (or 20 if you want to pull the meat apart).
6. When the meat is done, transfer to a large pot.
7. Add the sauce from the blender into the pot (to increase smoothness you can use a strainer).
8. Cook in low heat for an hour or until the desired consistency is achieved.
9. If you wish for a _soupy_ texture add more stock to the stew.
10. To serve, use small soup bowls, serve some stew and decorate with onions on top and cilantro. 


Enjoy!!!
