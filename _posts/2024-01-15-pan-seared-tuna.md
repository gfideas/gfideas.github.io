This recipe elevates the simple act of searing into an art form, creating a perfect harmony of textures and tastes. The succulent tuna steaks, encrusted with golden sesame seeds, offer a tantalizing contrast between the crisp exterior and tender, flaky interior. The subtle nuttiness of sesame seeds complements the bold, umami-rich flavor of the tuna, making every bite a sensory delight. 

## Ingredients

- 2 tuna steaks (about 6-8 ounces each), sushi-grade
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 2 teaspoons fresh ginger, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Green onions, sliced (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Pat the tuna steaks dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and black pepper.

2. In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, olive oil, honey, grated ginger, and minced garlic. Place the tuna steaks in a shallow dish and pour half of the marinade over them. Allow to marinate for at least 15-20 minutes.

3. Spread the sesame seeds on a plate. Press each side of the tuna steaks into the sesame seeds, ensuring they are evenly coated.

4. Heat a skillet or pan over medium-high heat. Add a bit of olive oil to coat the pan. Sear the tuna for about 1-2 minutes per side for a rare to medium-rare doneness. Adjust the time based on your preference and the thickness of the tuna steaks.

5. Once the tuna is seared, drizzle the remaining marinade over the steaks in the last minute of cooking, allowing the flavors to meld.

6. Transfer the pan-seared tuna to a serving plate. Garnish with sliced green onions.


Serve immediately, either as a standalone dish or with your favorite side, like steamed rice or a crisp salad. The combination of the sesame crust and flavorful marinade creates a dish that's not only visually appealing but also bursting with delicious Asian-inspired flavors.
