Elevate your dining experience with the exquisite fusion of pan-seared scallops and a decadent Marsala cream sauce. This dish harmoniously blends sweet scallops with the richness of Marsala wine, while onions and garlic add aromatic depth. Each bite is a symphony of textures and flavors, transforming a simple seafood dish into a culinary masterpiece.

## Ingredients

- 12 large sea scallops, patted dry
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup Marsala wine
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. Pat the scallops dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and black pepper.

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the scallops and sear for 1-2 minutes per side or until they develop a golden crust. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary. Once seared, transfer the scallops to a plate and set aside.

3. In the same skillet, add butter. Once melted, add chopped onions and cook until softened. Add minced garlic and saut√© for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

4. Pour Marsala wine into the skillet, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow the wine to simmer for 2-3 minutes until it reduces by half.

5. Pour in the heavy cream and stir to combine with the Marsala mixture. Add Dijon mustard, stirring until the sauce begins to thicken. Simmer for an additional 3-5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.

6. Gently place the seared scallops back into the skillet, spooning some of the Marsala cream sauce over them. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, ensuring the scallops are heated through.

7. Sprinkle fresh chopped parsley over the scallops and sauce. Serve the pan-seared scallops with Marsala cream sauce immediately, accompanied by lemon wedges for a burst of acidity.

Serve this dish over a bed of cooked pasta, rice, or with crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.
